  <blockquote><h3>Inustice 2 Announced, Coming Next Year</h3>

<footer>By Baden Ronie on June 8, 2016,	(1 Comment)</footer>

</blockquote>
  <p>Warner Bros. just made a pleasing announced: Injustice 2 is real.

The big change we can expect to see is a loot system that lets players build up and customize their characters. here’s what the official blurb has to say about it:  “As you gear up your characters, you’re building a roster of DC Super Heroes and Super-Villains that reflects your choices, and your preferences, which can be vastly different than your opponents. A few play sessions in, you can expect your Aquaman to look and play different than anyone else’s Aquaman you may come across.”

It#s an interesting prospect, if a dangerous one. Fighting games work by being very well balanced, and introducing a loot system complicates that by ensuring the developers have to thoroughly check that no piece of loot provides a massive advantage, otherwise players will get angry fast. It also opens the door for microtransactions, which we don’t need but that I fully expect to see in the final game.

According to Warner Bros. the new Injustice will be available sometime in 2017 for Xbox One and PS4. PC has not been mentioned, which could be something to do with Warner Bros. recent problems on that platform..</p>

  <p><blockquote><h3>Microsoft To Release Upgraded Xbox One With More Powerful GPU Next Year?</h3>

<footer>By Baden Ronie on May 25, 2016,	(5 Comment)</footer>

</blockquote>
  <p>One of the interesting and divisive talking points about this latest generation of consoles has been Sony’s desire to release a more powerful version of their Playstation 4, upgrading the GPU to deliver a better experience for a higher price. Such an idea has been highly controversial as many people feel it detracts from the simplicity that consoles are supposed to offer, while developers would also have to deal with varying hardware rather than being able to focus on one specific set of specs.  Two Months ago Kotaku claimed that Sony had project Neo, an upgraded PS4, in development

Now it seems Microsoft might be enacting this idea, too. According to Kotaku three sources within Microsoft have confirmed the existence of Scorpio, an Xbox One with an upgraded GPU that will be released next year. The plan is to make the console VR compatible, which would mean a relatively big upgrade as the current GPU that the Xbox One boasts isn’t even close to being able to handle VR properly. Whether we’d also see a better CPU is another question.

Back in March Xbox boss Phil Spencer did drop a few hints about this project being a reality, talking about how he’d like to see consoles adopt a PC-style evolution. Kotaku’s sources state that Microsoft would like to offer a steady stream of incremental upgrades.</p></p>
